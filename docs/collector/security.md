# Security and RBAC

Security considerations when running collectors under the operator, and the admission and RBAC
controls available to constrain what a collector can do.

## Privileged pod settings in the collector spec

> [!WARNING]
> The `OpenTelemetryCollector` spec exposes host-level pod settings — `hostPath` volumes,
> `hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, privileged security contexts — and the operator passes them to the
> generated workload as written. Anyone who can create an `OpenTelemetryCollector` gets everything
> those settings allow, which in `mode: daemonset` means root on every node. Treat `create` on
> `opentelemetrycollectors.opentelemetry.io` as equivalent to `create` on `daemonsets.apps`.

### What the spec exposes

These fields are copied into the generated PodSpec verbatim. The operator applies no security
filtering to them, and the validating webhook does not inspect them.

| Field | What it grants |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.volumes` with `hostPath` | Read/write access to any path on the node's filesystem |
| `spec.hostNetwork` | The node's network namespace, including loopback-only node services |
| `spec.hostPID` | The node's PID namespace, and visibility into every process on it |
| `spec.securityContext` | `privileged`, added capabilities, `runAsUser: 0` |
| `spec.podSecurityContext` | Pod-level UID/GID, sysctls, `fsGroup` |
| `spec.initContainers`, `spec.additionalContainers` | Arbitrary images and commands in the collector's pod, with their own security contexts and mounts |
| `spec.serviceAccount` | The pod runs with an existing ServiceAccount's token, and so with its permissions |
| `spec.tolerations`, `spec.nodeSelector`, `spec.affinity` | Placement on control-plane or otherwise restricted nodes |

Both served API versions, `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1`, expose them.

### Why they exist

Node-level telemetry requires node-level access:

- `filelog` reads container logs from `/var/log/pods`, which requires a `hostPath` volume.
- `hostmetrics` reads the host's `/proc` and `/sys`, and needs `hostPID` to attribute metrics to
  processes outside its own namespace.
- eBPF components such as the [OBI eBPF receiver](../use-cases/obi-ebpf-receiver.md) need
  `/sys/fs/cgroup` from the host plus capabilities like `BPF`, `PERFMON` and `SYS_PTRACE`.
- Receivers that bind node ports, such as statsd, need `hostNetwork`.

Rejecting these by default would break the operator's primary use case. Running a collector with them
set is normal.

### Where the trust boundary sits

The operator grants a collector nothing beyond what its pod spec asks for. What differs is that the
request arrives through a custom resource: an RBAC audit that flags `create` on `daemonsets.apps` will
not flag `create` on `opentelemetrycollectors.opentelemetry.io`, though in daemonset mode the two
confer the same capability.

In most clusters this is unremarkable, because collector CRs are written by the platform or
observability team, who already hold workload-create permissions in the relevant namespaces. If you
have instead granted collector-create to application teams on the assumption that it is a narrow,
telemetry-only permission, that assumption does not hold.

Two existing behaviors bound the problem:

- The generated workload always lands in the CR's own namespace, so Pod Security Admission on that
  namespace applies to the collector's pods.
- With `--create-rbac-permissions=true` (deprecated but functional), configs that require cluster RBAC,
  such as the `k8sattributes` processor, cause the operator to create ClusterRoles for the collector's
  ServiceAccount. The webhook first runs a SubjectAccessReview against the submitting user and rejects
  the request if they do not already hold those permissions. There is no equivalent check for the
  pod-level fields above.

### Restricting the fields

If unprivileged users need to create `OpenTelemetryCollector` resources, block the fields at admission.

#### Pod Security Admission

Labelling the namespace `baseline` or `restricted` blocks `hostPath`, `hostNetwork`, `hostPID` and
privileged containers on the resulting pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: tenant-a
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
```

The CR is still admitted and only the pods are rejected, so the user sees a healthy-looking resource
whose DaemonSet produces no pods, with the reason in the DaemonSet's events. PSA also does not
constrain `spec.serviceAccount`, `spec.tolerations` or `spec.nodeSelector`.

#### ValidatingAdmissionPolicy

Rejecting the CR gives a clear error at apply time. Built into Kubernetes, GA since 1.30:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-restrict-privileged
spec:
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
      - apiGroups: ["opentelemetry.io"]
        apiVersions: ["v1alpha1", "v1beta1"]
        operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
        resources: ["opentelemetrycollectors"]
  validations:
    - expression: "!has(object.spec.hostNetwork) || !object.spec.hostNetwork"
      message: "spec.hostNetwork is not allowed"
    - expression: "!has(object.spec.hostPID) || !object.spec.hostPID"
      message: "spec.hostPID is not allowed"
    - expression: "!has(object.spec.volumes) || object.spec.volumes.all(v, !has(v.hostPath))"
      message: "hostPath volumes are not allowed"
    - expression: >-
        !has(object.spec.securityContext) ||
        !has(object.spec.securityContext.privileged) ||
        !object.spec.securityContext.privileged
      message: "privileged security contexts are not allowed"
    - expression: >-
        !has(object.spec.additionalContainers) ||
        object.spec.additionalContainers.all(c,
          !has(c.securityContext) ||
          !has(c.securityContext.privileged) ||
          !c.securityContext.privileged)
      message: "privileged additionalContainers are not allowed"
    - expression: >-
        !has(object.spec.initContainers) ||
        object.spec.initContainers.all(c,
          !has(c.securityContext) ||
          !has(c.securityContext.privileged) ||
          !c.securityContext.privileged)
      message: "privileged initContainers are not allowed"
    - expression: >-
        !has(object.spec.targetAllocator) ||
        !has(object.spec.targetAllocator.securityContext) ||
        !has(object.spec.targetAllocator.securityContext.privileged) ||
        !object.spec.targetAllocator.securityContext.privileged
      message: "privileged security contexts are not allowed on the embedded target allocator"
```

Bind it to the namespaces holding untrusted collectors, leaving platform namespaces free to run
privileged node collectors:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-restrict-privileged
spec:
  policyName: otel-collector-restrict-privileged
  validationActions: ["Deny"]
  matchResources:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        otel-collector-privileged: "false"
```

#### Kyverno

The same expressions work in a `ClusterPolicy`, which adds an `Audit` mode for finding out what a
policy would break before enforcing it:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-restrict-privileged
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: block-privileged-pod-fields
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
                - opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1/OpenTelemetryCollector
                - opentelemetry.io/v1beta1/OpenTelemetryCollector
              namespaces: ["tenant-*"]
      validate:
        cel:
          expressions:
            - expression: "!has(object.spec.hostNetwork) || !object.spec.hostNetwork"
              message: "spec.hostNetwork is not allowed"
            - expression: "!has(object.spec.hostPID) || !object.spec.hostPID"
              message: "spec.hostPID is not allowed"
            - expression: "!has(object.spec.volumes) || object.spec.volumes.all(v, !has(v.hostPath))"
              message: "hostPath volumes are not allowed"
```

#### Getting the policy right

- **Cover both API versions.** `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` are both served. A policy listing only
  `v1beta1` can be evaded by submitting the other, unless you rely on the default
  `matchPolicy: Equivalent` to convert it.
- **Match `UPDATE`, not just `CREATE`.** Otherwise a benign collector can be edited into a privileged
  one after admission.
- **Close the escape hatches.** `additionalContainers` and `initContainers` carry their own
  `securityContext` and `volumeMounts`. Blocking `hostPath` while still allowing `spec.serviceAccount`
  to name any existing ServiceAccount lets a user borrow that account's permissions.
- **Exempt the namespaces that need the privileges.** Scope policies by namespace selector rather than
  applying them cluster-wide.
